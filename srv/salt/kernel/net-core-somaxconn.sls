# During uWSGI graceful reloads, we expect new clients to wait 10 seconds (best case) to start seeing contents,
# but, unfortunately, we have hundreds of concurrent requests, so first 100 customers will wait during the server warm-up,
# while the others will get an error from the proxy, by default.
# This happens because the default size of uWSGIâ€™s listen queue is 100 slots.
# it is an average value choosen by the maximum value allowed by default by system kernel.
# Each operating system has a default limit (Linux has 128, for example),
# so before increasing it we need to increase our kernel limit too.
